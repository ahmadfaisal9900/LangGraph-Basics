## Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. **Open the application**
   - Simply double‑click `index.html` to open it in your default browser, **or**
   - Run a local development server (optional but recommended for live‑reload and proper handling of relative URLs):
     ```bash
     # Using Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000

     # Using Node.js (http‑server package)
     npx http-server . -p 8000
     ```
   - Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Features
- Clean and responsive layout using modern CSS.
- Interactive UI elements powered by vanilla JavaScript.
- Easy-to‑customize stylesheet (`style.css`).
- Modular JavaScript (`app.js`) for handling DOM manipulation and events.
- No external dependencies; runs entirely in the browser.
